# hi you, welcome to my repository
#### according to the title this time, I uploaded a repository about discord.js v14


## Question and Answer
<details>
<summary>What is discord.js?</summary>
<p>[discord.js](https://discord.js.org) is one of the most popular in making discord bots</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Why should there be a handle?</summary>
<p>The handler itself aims to make it easier to find files and folders that you have created, after all, the neater it is, the better it is to see it, right?</p>
</details>

## The first step 
in discord.js v14, you really need to use nodejs v16, or the latest version of nodejs, for more information about nodejs, you can see [here](https://nodejs.org/en)
and make sure you have actually installed it first.

## second step
download or clone this repository, then open the file on your desktop

## third step
Open your terminal then type the code as below.

```
npm install discord.js fs mongoose
```
or if you don't want to use any database, or want to use another database, you can block the code related to the database that I use

```
/*
   ...code
*/
```

## fourth step
open and edit the file called `settings/config.json`

```json
{
  "token": "your discord bot token",
  "mongodb": "your mongodb url",
  "developer": ["626413361185292321", "your discord ID", "62641336118529XXXX"],
  "prefix": ">",
  "testguild":"your discord server ID",
  "support":""
}
```
but I would recommend saving the token and mongodb url in `.env`
```
token=your discord bot token
mongodb=your mongodb url
```

## the last step 
make sure everything is correct, then open your terminal, and type the command as below

```
node .
```

#### congratulations, your bot is now online, and ready to be developed ...
